    (MMS, PI: Jo Van Steenbergen).
    OCR: Calfa
    Text processed by Manhal Makhoul MMS-II.
    NOTE OF THE ANNOTATOR (HRH): Based on what the editor writes in his introduction (page 23), the appendix at the end of the text is written by the author and should not be split as a separate text, as far as I can understand.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
