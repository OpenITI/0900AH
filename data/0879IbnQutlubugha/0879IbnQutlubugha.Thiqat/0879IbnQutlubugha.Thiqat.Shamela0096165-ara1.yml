90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: the name of the annotator (latin characters; please
        use consistently)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
        See, `README.md` for details.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The alphabetical order of names in the text does not
        continue after Muhammad; however, this is not a problem in the digital text. The
        rest of the text might be missing in the original manuscript since the PDF ends
        at this point as well. 2- Pagination problems reported by the annotator are
        actually problems in the pagination of the PDF. The pagination of the digital
        text is correct.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
