90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text provided by the ERC Project
    "The Mamlukisation of the Mamluk Sultanate"
    (MMS, PI: Jo Van Steenbergen).
    Text processed by Kenneth Goudie & Jo Van Steenbergen MMS.
   NOTE OF THE ANNOTATOR (HRH): The first-level header is for the years 
   and the blank second-level headers are for the months 
   (based on the table of contents at the end of the volumes). 
   There is a third level of titles that are for events. 
   Sometimes some other events are mentioned after them without having new titles. 
   So, some titles are needed to be added by closely reading the text.
