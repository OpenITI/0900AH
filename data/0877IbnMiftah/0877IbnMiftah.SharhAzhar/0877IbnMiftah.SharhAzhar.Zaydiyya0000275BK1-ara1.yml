90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Zaydiyya0000275 is a digitization of (a pirated
        edition of?)  ʿAlī Yaḥyā al-Yamānī's edition of the Sharḥ al-Azhār
        (Cairo 1332: Maṭbaʿat Sharikat al-Tamaddun), not including its long
        introduction containing al-Jundārī's Tarājim, nor the footnotes and
        ḥawāshī.  Vol. 3 includes another text related to the Sharḥ al-Azhār,
        al-Ḥīmī's Tabṣira.  PV split off that work into a separate text file. PV
        also removed the ḥawāshī in the footnotes, which, according to the title
        page, came from a manuscript (dated 1207 AH) that was copied (including
        the ḥawāshī)  from a manuscript of and read to Shaykh al-Islām al-qāḍī
        al-ʿallāma  Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Shawkānī.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All the headers were mixed with the body text. I
        tried to separate them. However, the printed version has a very bad quality and
        it is not clear where the body text begins. So, I did this based on my
        understanding of the text, and most probably I have made a few mistakes in it.
        Most of the headers are just fasl without further explanation to say about what
        it is. Sometimes it is possible to tag the first short sentence in the body text
        as the header to clarify this. In other cases, explanation should be added in
        square brackets by a specialist in Fiqh. In some cases, page numbers were in the
        middle of the headers. I moved them to the end of the headers. There were also
        third-level headers that appeared after first-level headers. I changed their
        levelling to second-level.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
