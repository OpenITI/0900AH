90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has a rather complicated structure since there is no
    border between biographies/obituaries and the events or toponyms. So, they
    should be regarded with care. I tagged everything as far as I could. 2. There is
    an appendix at the end of the text which is a Qasida published separately and is
    attached to the text by the editor since it was most probably in one of the
    manuscripts of this text that the editor did not have access to (see the
    footnote in the PDF page 2/345).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
